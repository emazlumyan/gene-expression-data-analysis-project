# Project: Gene Expression Data Analysis
## Authors: Eric Mazlumyan, Isaac Brooks-Church

**Project Context**

The Gene Expression Data Analysis project was part of the curriculum of the course MCDB 172 (Biological Dynamics) at UC Santa Barbara. The project tasked students with selecting a published scientific research article and performing data analysis techniques on article data to extract useful scientific information.

**Project Overview**

The program executes data analysis techniques on data from the 2007 BMC Systems Biology article "Simultaneous clustering of gene expression data with clinical chemistry and pathological evaluations reveals phenotypic prototypes" by Bushel et al including principal component analysis and k-means clustering, discussed further in depth in geneexpdata_analysis_report.pdf. Below are the citation for the article and link to the article.

**Compilation Information**

- The program is written in Python and is of the .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file format. It is designed to be run in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
- The program is designed to import data files by the names of "geneexpdata_import.csv" and "Actual_rat_alt_data_import - Sheet1.csv". The GitHub repository does not include these data files. The data pertaining to the article used in the program is publicly accessible at the link to the article and through the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus at the NCBI link provided below. The latter can also be accessed by querying platform accession number GPL890 in the Gene Expression Omnibus and selecting "View full table...".
