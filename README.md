# Project: Gene Expression Data Analysis
## Authors: Eric Mazlumyan, Isaac Brooks-Church

**Project Context**

The Gene Expression Data Analysis group project was part of the curriculum of the course MCDB 172 (Biological Dynamics) at UC Santa Barbara. The project tasked students with selecting a published scientific research article and performing data analysis techniques on article data to extract useful scientific information.

**Project Overview**

The program executes data analysis techniques on data from the 2007 BMC Systems Biology article "Simultaneous clustering of gene expression data with clinical chemistry and pathological evaluations reveals phenotypic prototypes" by Bushel et al including principal component analysis and k-means clustering, discussed further in depth in geneexpdata_analysis_report.pdf. Below are the citation for the article and link to the article.

**Compilation Information**

- The program is written in Python and is of the .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file format. It is designed to be run in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
- The program is designed to import data connected to the article which is accessible to the public. This publicly accessible data that the program uses is formatted in three .csv files that are included in this repository for program compilation and for reference. Upload of .csv files "geneexpdata_import.csv" and "Actual_rat_alt_data_import - Sheet1.csv" into Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment is required for the program to be able to run.
- The data used in the program is publicly accessible through the link to the article and through the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus at the NCBI link provided below. The destination of the NCBI link provided below can also be accessed by querying platform accession number GPL890 in the Gene Expression Omnibus and selecting "View full table...".
